## About

Every year I use the Advent of Code challenges to teach myself a new programming language and build up my problem-solving skills.

This year, I've chosen the language **[Go](go.dev)**, and will be practising [test driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) throughout the month.
